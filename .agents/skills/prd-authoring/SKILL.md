description: |-
  Guide for authoring comprehensive PRDs with parallel planning support. Use for drafting technical specifications, defining requirements, and synthesizing planner outputs. Use proactively when creating PRDs, architecture designs, or implementation plans.
  Examples:
  - user: "Draft a PRD for user auth" → create PRD with purpose, requirements, and scenarios
  - user: "Analyze these PRD requirements" → verify SHALL/MUST usage and scenario structure
  - user: "Synthesize planner outputs" → merge the strongest parts of multiple generated PRDs
  - user: "Create a PRD template" → setup standard sections and placeholder content

- Complete technical specifications
- Actionable task lists with priorities
- Relevant code snippets and examples
- Clear implementation phases
- Measurable success criteria

</overview>

<quality_standards>

## What Makes a Good PRD

A good PRD MUST be:
- **Actionable**: Each requirement can be implemented directly
- **Complete**: Covers functional, non-functional, and technical requirements
- **Specific**: Uses precise language, avoiding vague terms like "should" or "might"
- **Measurable**: Includes success metrics that can be quantified
- **Implementable**: Contains sufficient detail for engineering to build

## Required Elements

Every PRD MUST include:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear articulation of what problem we're solving and why
2. **Goals** - Specific, measurable objectives
3. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Architecture** - System design, components, data flow
5. **Implementation Plan** - Phased approach with milestones
6. **Task List** - Actionable next steps (see template below)
7. **Success Metrics** - Quantifiable measures of success
8. **Code Snippets** - Relevant examples (see guidelines below)

</quality_standards>

<parallelization_guidance>

### Task Parallelization

Mark tasks as **Parallelizable: Yes** when:
- Task is independent of other in-progress tasks
- Multiple developers/subagents can work on different aspects simultaneously
- Task can be split into independent sub-tasks

**Examples:**

✅ **Parallelizable**
- "Design REST API endpoints" and "Design database schema" - can be done simultaneously with coordination
- "Write frontend user profile component" and "Write frontend settings component" - independent components
- "Set up CI/CD pipeline" and "Set up monitoring infrastructure" - separate infrastructure tasks

❌ **Not Parallelizable**
- "Implement authentication" - blocks on "Design database schema" (dependency)
- "Write API tests" - requires API endpoints to exist first (dependency)

**Format for parallelizable tasks:**
```markdown
- Parallelizable: Yes - Can run concurrently with [TASK-X], [TASK-Y]
```

</parallelization_guidance>

<complexity_guidance>

### Task Complexity Levels

**Simple**
- Well-defined scope
- No unknown unknowns
- Follows established patterns
- Single system/component
- Example: "Add email validation to registration form"

**Medium**
- Some research or investigation needed
- Multiple components to integrate
- Requires decision-making
- Some ambiguity to resolve
- Example: "Implement OAuth 2.0 login with Google and GitHub"

**Complex**
- Significant architectural decisions
- Cross-system dependencies
- High ambiguity or research required
- Performance or security concerns
- Requires prototyping or spikes
- Example: "Design and implement real-time notification system with WebSocket scaling"

</complexity_guidance>

<testing_guidance>

### Testing Requirements

Each task MUST specify testing needs:

**Required** - Critical functionality, MUST have tests before merging
- User authentication/authorization
- Payment processing
- Data persistence operations
- External API integrations

**Recommended** - Should have tests but not blocking
- UI components
- Business logic validation
- Edge case handling
- Error scenarios

**None** - Tests not applicable
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates
- Infrastructure setup
- Design/mockup tasks

**Test Types:**
- `unit` - Individual functions/components in isolation
- `integration` - Multiple components working together
- `e2e` - Full user flows from start to finish
- `performance` - Load testing, benchmarks
- `security` - Penetration testing, vulnerability scans

</testing_guidance>

```

</prd_template>

<code_snippet_guidelines>

## When to Include Code Snippets

PRDs SHOULD include code snippets when they clarify technical details. Use for:

### 1. API Design
**Include when**: Defining endpoints, request/response formats

```typescript
// POST /api/users
interface CreateUserRequest {
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed with bcrypt
  name: string;
}

interface CreateUserResponse {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 2. Data Schemas
**Include when**: Defining database models, type definitions

```typescript
// User schema
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID
  email: string; // Unique, indexed
  passwordHash: string; // bcrypt
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Indexes
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

### 3. Configuration Examples
**Include when**: Defining feature flags, environment variables

```bash
# Environment variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100
```

### 4. Algorithm Examples
**Include when**: Explaining complex logic

```typescript
// Rate limiting algorithm
function rateLimit(userId: string): boolean {
  const requests = redis.get(`ratelimit:${userId}`) || 0;
  if (requests >= LIMIT) {
    return false; // Rate limited
  }
  redis.incr(`ratelimit:${userId}`);
  redis.expire(`ratelimit:${userId}`, 60);
  return true; // Allowed
}
```

### 5. Integration Examples
**Include when**: Showing how components interact

```typescript
// Example: Service A calling Service B
const response = await fetch('http://service-b/api/process', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ data: payload })
});
```

### What NOT to Include

❌ **Full implementation code** - PRDs are for requirements, not implementation
❌ **Business logic details** - Save for actual development
❌ **Boilerplate code** - Unless it's configuration

✅ **DO include**: Interfaces, schemas, examples of architecture
✅ **DO include**: Configuration, API contracts, data models

</code_snippet_guidelines>

<task_list_guidelines>

## Creating Actionable Task Lists

Tasks in PRDs MUST be:

### Specific
❌ "Implement user authentication"
✅ "Implement OAuth 2.0 login with Google and GitHub providers"

### Testable
❌ "Make it fast"
✅ "API response time <200ms at p95 under 1000 RPS"

### Atomic
❌ "Build the entire checkout flow"
✅ "Build cart summary endpoint" (one of many tasks)

### Testable
Each task MUST specify testing requirements (Required/Recommended/None)

## Task Template (AI-Agent Optimized)

```markdown
- [ ] **[TASK-ID]** [Actionable title]
  - **Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
  - **Dependencies**: [Task IDs or components that must exist first]
  - **Parallelizable**: [Yes/No - if Yes, specify which tasks]
  - **Testing**: [Required/Recommended/None - specify type: unit, integration, e2e]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] [Criterion 1 - must be testable]
    - [ ] [Criterion 2 - must be testable]
```

</task_list_guidelines>

<anti_patterns>

## Common PRD Anti-Patterns

### Vague Language
❌ "The system should be scalable"
✅ "System must handle 10,000 concurrent users with <500ms response time"

### Missing Acceptance Criteria
❌ "Implement search functionality"
✅ "Implement full-text search with filters, returning results in <100ms, supporting 100+ concurrent searches"

### No Success Metrics
❌ "Improve user engagement"
✅ "Increase daily active users from 1,000 to 2,000 within 90 days"

### Infinite Scope
❌ "Build the best e-commerce platform"
✅ "Build MVP with product catalog, cart, and checkout (payments via Stripe)"

### Missing Technical Details
❌ "Use a database"
✅ "Use PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching, with proper indexing on email and product_id"

### No Risk Assessment
❌ [No risk section]
✅ [Include risks table with mitigations]
